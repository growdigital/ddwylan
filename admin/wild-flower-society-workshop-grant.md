# Funding for activities for children, families or young people which involve learning about wild plants (the wildflower society are particularly keen for trusts to take up this funding opportunity)

* Grants of up to Â£250 per activity
* We are looking for events where children will learn to recognise flowers and other plants growing in the wild rather than, for example, wildflower gardening.
* The plant-based activity could be a whole new event, or it could be one activity within an existing wildlife event, or a botanical session for a regular group or within an ongoing programme of events.
* The funding could cover staff time, materials, or other costs.
* This funding may be applied for in addition to botanical training funding
Application requirements (no official form)

* A brief outline of the proposed activities, including the following information
* how the money will be spent
* who is to run the event/activity
* date(s), location(s) and duration of the event/activity
* types of activity involved
* target age range and expected number of young people/children participating
Conditions of the Grant for both

* If you are successful in obtaining a grant, we ask that you acknowledge our support in your publicity. 

* A condition of the grant is that, once the training is completed, we require feedback in the form of a brief report of at least 200 words with photos if possible.

Application deadline for both
